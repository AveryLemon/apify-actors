# Apify Competitive Intelligence — Updated July 4, 2026

> **Living document.** Every siphon session updates this file. Gaps found create tickets in TICKETS/.

## Competitive Landscape Overview

The Apify Store has **47,173 actors** — overwhelmingly **web scrapers** (95%+). The AI/Creative category has ~6,337 actors, but the vast majority of those are also scrapers labeled as "AI" because they feed LLM pipelines.

**Key insight for OWL:** The creative/analysis niche is virtually empty. Audio tools have 3 actors total. Image analysis beyond OCR has ~5 actors. Video generation: zero. This is OWL's blue ocean.

## Category 1: Web Scraping (Top 10 by runs — all scrapers)

| # | Actor | Developer | Users | Price | Notes |
|---|-------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Google Maps Scraper | compass | 426K+ | $2.10/1K | Most popular on platform |

| 9 | Instagram Post Scraper | apify | 95K+ | PPR | — |

| Actor | Developer | What It Does | Runs | Gaps |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|------|

| Compute cost per run | Music segment-level mood/energy profiling |
| Time to first run | Stem separation from any audio URL |
| | Brand consistency scoring |
| | Content repurposing pipeline (video→clips→social) |
| | Cross-modal analysis (audio + image together) |

## Key Competitors (to watch)

| Developer | Territory | Threat Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| musicae | Spotify/DJ audio features | LOW — limited to Spotify API, no audio file analysis | |
| akash9078 | Image utilities (basic) | LOW — shallow analysis, broad but shallow collection | |
| marielise.dev | Image SEO/quality | LOW — narrow focus on SEO metadata | |
| milastream | Image generation | LOW — generation only, no analysis | |
| singlesurge | Music generation | MEDIUM — only 1 competitor, very new | |

**OWL's strategic advantage:** Combined analysis + generation is something NO competitor does. Musicae only analyzes Spotify data. Singlesurge only generates. OWL does BOTH from any audio source.

---

## Siphoning Notes

### Musicae's dj-track-audio-analyzer — What to Steal
- **Input:** Spotify track URL → returns BPM, key, Camelot, rhythm, harmony, DJ scores
- **Weakness:** ONLY works with Spotify. NO audio file upload. NO mood/emotion. NO energy curve. NO stem separation.
- **Our move:** Build the same DJ-friendly output BUT from ANY audio source + add mood + add energy arc + add stem quality score.

### milastream's ai-image-generator — What to Steal
- **Input:** Text prompt → image
- **Weakness:** Generic text-to-image. No style consistency, no brand voice, no batch mode.
- **Our move:** Brand voice image generator — generate images consistent with a brand's existing visual identity.

### singlesurge's ai-music-studio-generator — What to Watch
- **Input:** Text prompt → song + remix + instrumental + cover art
- **Strength:** Multi-format output. First mover in music gen on Apify.
- **Weakness:** Generic prompts. No brand voice. No mood targeting.
- **Our move:** Mood-targeted music generation with brand consistency. "Generate brand-consistent background music for [brand] with [mood] energy."
